# Where-is-my-item</br>
This is my original module</br>
I made this because i alaways forgot my item</br>
Sometime it's not in the bank</br>
Maybe in some chracter</br>
Why need to relog all and check</br>
so wasted time lol~~~</br>

Command
- forgot, where, item [name]
- forgot, where, item [itemId]
- forgot, where, item [itemLink]
  
 Something you need to know
* You can change the command in config.json
* The config.json will generate after login
* Data will saved after you relog to character screen
