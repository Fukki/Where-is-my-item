# Where-is-my-item
This is my original module
I made this because i alaways forgot my item
Sometime it's not in the bank
Maybe in some chracter
Why need to relog all and check
so wasted time lol~~~

Command
- forgot, where, item [name]
- forgot, where, item [itemId]
- forgot, where, item [itemLink]
  
 Something you need to know
* You can change the command in config.json
* The config.json will generate after login
* Data will saved after you relog to character screen
